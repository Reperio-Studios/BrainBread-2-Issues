##BrainBread 2

BrainBread 2 is a standalone Half-Life 2 Source Mod.

This repository is meant for submitting bugs and issues that exist in BrainBread 2.

##Reporting Issues

To begin submitting issues, look at the right hand side of this page, and click ISSUES. Then click the green NEW ISSUE button. You must have a GitHub account in order to start posting them.

Please press the 'S' key to start a search for similar issues already reported. *Include closed issues in your search.*

If the issue hasn't been reported yet, please feel free to submit the issue here with the following information.

  * A short title, describing the issue. e.g. "Fred doesn't spawn on the map X"
  * A detailed summary
  * Current Version
  * What happens
  * When does it happen
  * Steps to reproduce the issue (How did you do it?)
  * Screenshots
  * Video (YouTube) captures of the issue
  * System information
      * In Steam, (Help > System Information). Copy and paste into a blockquote (add a > in front of each line).

##If your game crashes

If while playing BB2, you inexplicably get thrown to the desktop with an error window (hl2.exe has stopped responding), do the following:

* Don't close the game until the error window gives you a prompt to close it (when the OK button appears)
* Follow the same directions as mentioned above in **Reporting Issues** but:
* Before you submit the issue, check your Dumps folder (located in steam\dumps) to see if there's a newly generated .mdmp file (They normally look like "crash_hl2.exe248123_1.dmp")
* If there is an .mdmp file, upload and attach it to your issue ticket and then submit it

If you use Linux or Mac and your game crashes, please check the Steam System Information window (Steam > Help > System Information) to see if an error has been reported in the output window. If there is one, the report will also list out a location where it will generate a crash file, generally located in /tmp/dumps.

For Ubuntu/CentOS Linux users (or anyone using Unity/Gnome): 
* Open up your File manager (the File Cabinet icon on the side bar).
* Under Devices, click Computer.
* Now double click on the tmp folder.
* You should see a dumps folder, containing some files. Either post them in GitHub (the .mdmp files), or send an email to support@reperio-studios.net with the files attached.

For Mac users:
* Open up Finder
* Search for tmp/dumps 

##Code of Conduct

Since this will ideally be used by the public to help centralize and organize the issues present in the mod, the team would appreciate if you can remember the following:

* Do not insult, harass, or demean anyone.
* Do not intentionally multi-post an issue.
* Avoid using ALL CAPS when creating an issue report.
* Do not repeatably update an open issue, saying that the issue persists.
* Do not use exploits for your own gain, this tracker is up in goodwill to allow the public to help the dev team out with bug reporting.
